# Elements of the video

- Duration: 10 seconds

Background layer — Apply a Gaussian blur, lower the brightness slightly, and stretch it to fill the screen.

Foreground layer — Place the clear, unblurred version centered with soft shadows and a subtle border glow to give it a 3D "cutout" effect.

Overlay a centered quote in a clean, readable serif font (e.g., Georgia or Garamond). Use white text with a soft black shadow for contrast.

Start the video with a fade-in
End the video with a fade-out and a silent pause of 1 second.
